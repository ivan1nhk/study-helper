本程序完全使用GitHub copilot上面的Claude sonnet 4.5编写，一共耗时两个小时，在此之前我不会任何的js或者程序开发
就连上传GitHub都是让ai教我的
我也不知道怎么回事，反正node_modules莫名其妙的有400mb大小，应该都是ai下载的依赖包吧
我是用vs code启动的，也不知道在别的电脑能不能正常用
其实内容很简单，就是让我能分屏看网课视频和下载的pdf
什么？Windows的分屏功能就能实现这些功能？好吧，just for fun而已

This program was entirely written using Claude sonnet 4.5 on GitHub Copilot. It took me two hours to complete. Before this, I had no knowledge of JavaScript or programming at all. 
Even uploading to GitHub was taught to me by an AI. 
I have no idea why, but the node_modules folder is inexplicably 400MB in size. I guess it's all the dependencies that the AI downloaded. 
I started it with VS Code and I'm not sure if it will work properly on other computers. 
The content is actually very simple. It just allows me to view online course videos and downloaded PDFs in split screens. 
What? Can Windows' split-screen function achieve these functions? Well, it's just for fun anyway.
